# Introduction
In epidemiological studies, it is a new trend to add 95% CIs in Table 1 instead of the p-value. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of study participants by disease status. 
This R script returns summary statistics of both continuous and categorical variables.

## Continuous variables
This script returns the means, standard deviations, and the lower and upper bounds of the 95% CI.

## Categorical variables
For dichotomous variables, this script returns the raw counts, proportions, and the lower and upper bounds of the 95% CI. 
For categorical variables with more than two levels, please guide yourself and manually run the lines of code at the bottom.
